# AI-Driven Security in Cloud Computing: Enhancing Threat Detection, Automated Response, and Cyber Resilience — Shaffi et al., 2025

## Purpose
This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can address the limits of traditional cloud security, which is too slow and reactive for modern, distributed systems.

## AI Applications in Security
- Threat Detection & Anomaly Monitoring** — ML models analyze network traffic, logs, and behavior to spot suspicious activity faster and with fewer false positives.  
- Automated Response — AI can isolate compromised workloads, revoke access, or update microsegmentation rules instantly.  
- Predictive Analytics — Uses historical data to anticipate attacks and proactively tighten controls.  
- Encryption Management — AI can handle key rotation, algorithm selection, and adaptive cryptography.

## Benefits
- Real-time, adaptive defense.  
- Reduced human workload and faster reaction to emerging threats.  
- Improved accuracy over static rules.

## Challenges
- High computational cost for training AI models.  
- Risk of data bias and poor detection accuracy if datasets are weak.  
- Privacy and compliance concerns when using sensitive data.  
- Over-reliance on automation may cause blind spots.

## Relevance for This Project
Provides a playbook for using AI to strengthen Zero Trust.  
Its ideas (policy automation, anomaly detection, predictive risk) can be applied to DevOps CI/CD pipelines to secure deployments without slowing them down.
